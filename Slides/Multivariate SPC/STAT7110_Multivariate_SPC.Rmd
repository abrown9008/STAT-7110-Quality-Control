## Introduction

- In modern organizations, processes have become increasingly complex and intertwined with other processes.

\vskip 0.10 in

- Think about our coffee shop example from early in the semester. We drew out a flow chart showing that customer satisfaction, our ultimate goal, can be measured by several different items, including speed of service and perceived quality. 

\vskip 0.10 in

- Or in a manufacturing example, suppose we need to monitor both the inner and outer diameter of a bearing to ensure the bearing's usefulness for whatever its intended purpose is. 

## Introduction

- We can (and certainly people do) use individual control charts for each of the quality characteristics we're monitoring. 

\vskip 0.10 in

- For example, in the bearing monitoring example, we could use a Shewhart $\bar{X}$ and $s$ chart for both the inner and outer diameters. However, this may not be optimum.

```

## Introduction

- So it's clear that simultaneous monitoring of these two univariate processes is giving us insight that isn't so clear with separate monitoring. 

\vskip 0.10 in

- However, this procedure illustrated by Figure 11.2 isn't super useful beyond three processes (how do we visualize four dimensions??).

\vskip 0.10 in

- Moreover, such a procedure becomes incredibly cumbersome when you're trying to set up and maintain multiple charts (especially Shewhart $\bar{X}$ and $R$ or $s$ charts as they're already two chart schemes!).

## Introduction

- We also run into another problem. Suppose the inner and outer diameters of the bearings are independent of each other. Further suppose that we set up individual $\bar{X}$ and $s$ charts for both processes such that the probability of a false alarm is $\alpha$ for both charts. 

\vskip 0.10 in

- What's the probability that both charts (focused just on $\bar{X}$ here) plot in between their respective control limits?

$$ P\big[(LCL_1 < \bar{x}_1 < UCL_1)\cap (LCL_2 < \bar{x}_2 < UCL_2)\big|\text{IC}\big] =$$
$$ P\big[(LCL_1 < \bar{x}_1 < UCL_1)\big|\text{IC}\big]\times P\big[(LCL_2 < \bar{x}_2 < UCL_2)\big|\text{IC}\big] = (1-\alpha)^2 $$


## Introduction

- This then suggests that the true probability of a false alarm is:

$$\alpha^{'} = 1 - (1-\alpha)^2 $$

- So for example, if $\alpha = 0.0027$, then $\alpha^{'} = `r round(1-(1-0.0027)**2,4) `$. 

\vskip 0.10 in

- This is obviously not ideal. So what do we do? We can take advantage of control charts specifically designed for monitoring multivariate processes.

## A Review of the Multivariate Normal Distribution

- But first, we need to review the multivariate normal distribution. Recall the univariate distribution:

$$ f(x|\mu,\sigma^2) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}\exp\bigg(-\frac{1}{2}\big(\frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}\big)^2\bigg), \quad x \in \mathbb{R} $$

- We can think of the exponentiated term as the standardized square distance an observation, $x$, is from its mean, $\mu$. We can rewrite this as:

$$ (x-\mu)(\sigma^2)^{-1}(x-\mu) $$

## A Review of the Multivariate Normal Distribution

- This general structure is referred to as the quadratic form and is foundational in multivariate statistical methods. 

\vskip 0.10 in

- The multivariate normal distribution is a generalization of the univarite normal distribution where we have $p$-jointly distributed normal variables with possibly differing means and variances, but also potentially having covariance, too. 

$$ f(\mathbf{x} | \mathbf{\mu}, \Sigma) = \frac{1}{(2\pi)^{p/2}|\Sigma|^{1/2}}\exp\bigg(-\frac{1}{2}(\mathbf{(x-\mu)^T}\Sigma^{-1}\mathbf{(x-\mu)})\bigg) $$

## A Review of the Multivariate Normal Distribution

- Let's think about the multivariate normal from a slightly different perspective. Suppose I have a $p$-dimensional vector, $\mathbf{x}$, that is distributed as a multivariate normal.

\vskip 0.10 in

- What this implies is:

$$ \mathbf{x} = \begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \\ \vdots \\ x_p \end{bmatrix} \sim N(\mathbf{\mu},\mathbf{\Sigma})$$
## A Review of the Multivariate Normal Distribution

- Here, $\mathbf{\mu}$ is a $p$-dimensional vector of means and $\mathbf{\Sigma}$ is a $p\times p$ variance-covariance matrix.

$$ \mathbf{\mu} = \begin{bmatrix} \mu_1 \\ \mu_2 \\ \vdots \\ \mu_p \end{bmatrix} $$

## A Review of the Multivariate Normal Distribution

- The variance-covariance matrix, $\mathbf{\Sigma}$, is a $p\times p$ matrix where the diagonal elements are the variances of the variables and the off-diagonal elements are the covariances between the variables.

$$ \mathbf{\Sigma} = \begin{bmatrix} \sigma^2_1 & \sigma_{12} & \sigma_{13} & \dots & \sigma_{1p} \\
                            \sigma_{21} & \sigma^2_2 & \sigma_{23} & \dots & \sigma_{2p} \\
                            \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\
                            \sigma_{p1} & \sigma_{p2} & \sigma_{p3} & \dots & \sigma^2_p 
            \end{bmatrix} $$

## A Review of the Multivariate Normal Distribution

- So an individual $x$ has a marginal distribution that is univariate normal with mean $\mu_i$ and variance $\sigma^2_i$.

\vskip 0.10 in

- Don't worry too much about the complicated aspects of this distribution but know that it is the foundation of multivariate statistical methods, including multivariate SPC.

## A Multivariate Extension of the Shewhart $\bar{X}$ Chart: Hotelling's $T^2$ Control Chart

- One of the most well-known and widely used multivariate control charts is called, "Hotelling's $T^2$ Control Chart" or "Hotelling's $T^2$" for short. Hotelling developed this chart during WW2 as a way of monitoring bombsight data. 

\vskip 0.10 in

- This chart is the multivariate analogue to the Shewhart $\bar{X}$ chart. 

\vskip 0.10 in

- As is the case with univariate control charts, we generally have a Phase I and Phase II component.
    - How do we estimate the mean vector and variance-covariance matrix in Phase I?
    
## A Multivariate Extension of the Shewhart $\bar{X}$ Chart: Hotelling's $T^2$ Control Chart

- When we take a sample of size $n$ with multivariate data, what we get is $n$-vectors each with $p$-variables

$$ \mathbf{x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n} $$

where:

$$ \mathbf{x_i} = \begin{bmatrix} x_{11} \\ x_{21} \\ \vdots \\ x_{p1} \end{bmatrix} $$

## A Multivariate Extension of the Shewhart $\bar{X}$ Chart: Hotelling's $T^2$ Control Chart

- So then the sample mean will also be a vector where each element is the univariate sample mean of the variable held in its position.

$$ \bar{\mathbf{x}} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\mathbf{x_i} $$

## A Multivariate Extension of the Shewhart $\bar{X}$ Chart: Hotelling's $T^2$ Control Chart

- What about the variance-covariance matrix? Let's first consider the structure of the matrix when it's known:

$$ \Sigma = \begin{bmatrix} \sigma^2_1 & \sigma_{12} & \sigma_{13} & \dots & \sigma_{1p} \\
                            \sigma_{21} & \sigma^2_2 & \sigma_{23} & \dots & \sigma_{2p} \\
                            \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\
                            \sigma_{p1} & \sigma_{p2} & \sigma_{p3} & \dots & \sigma^2_p 
            \end{bmatrix} $$
            
            
## A Multivariate Extension of the Shewhart $\bar{X}$ Chart: Hotelling's $T^2$ Control Chart

- When $\Sigma$ is unknown, we have to estimate it. All of the diagonal elements, being the variances, can be estimated in the typical way:

$$ s^2_j = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_{ij} - \bar{x}_j)^2 $$


- and all of the off-diagonal elements, being the covariances, can be estimated by:

$$ s_{jk} = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_{ij} - \bar{x}_j)(x_{ik} - \bar{x}_k) $$

## A Multivariate Extension of the Shewhart $\bar{X}$ Chart: Hotelling's $T^2$ Control Chart

- We can generalize this into one step (typically done using software):

$$ \mathbf{S} = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(\mathbf{x_i} - \bar{\mathbf{x}})(\mathbf{x_i} - \bar{\mathbf{x}})^T $$

## A Multivariate Extension of the Shewhart $\bar{X}$ Chart: Hotelling's $T^2$ Control Chart

- Now that we know a little bit more about how to estimate the multivariate mean and variance-covariance matrix in Phase I, let's see how this can be applied to the Hotelling's $T^2$ Chart.

\vskip 0.10 in

- Once we have our Phase I estimates, we can construct the $T^2$ plotting statistic as:

$$ T^2 = n(\bar{\mathbf{x}} - \bar{\bar{\mathbf{x}}})^T\mathbf{S}^{-1}(\bar{\mathbf{x}} - \bar{\bar{\mathbf{x}}}) $$

- If the process is in-control, $T^2$ follows an F distribution. The text recommends using different control limits in Phase I and in Phase II. 

## A Multivariate Extension of the Shewhart $\bar{X}$ Chart: Hotelling's $T^2$ Control Chart

- For Phase I:

$$ UCL = \frac{p(m-1)(n-1)}{mn-m-p+1}F_{\alpha,p,mn-m-p+1} $$
$$ LCL = 0 $$

- For Phase II:

$$ UCL = \frac{p(m+1)(n-1)}{mn-m-p+1}F_{\alpha,p,mn-m-p+1} $$
$$ LCL = 0 $$

## A Multivariate Extension of the Shewhart $\bar{X}$ Chart: Hotelling's $T^2$ Control Chart

- Let's go through an example using the Can Volume Data Excel file. In these data, we are supposing that we are monitoring three different soda can filling machines.

\vskip 0.10 in

- In Phase I, we have taken $m=25$ samples of size $n=10$ from each machine. 

\vskip 0.10 in

- The data are contained in three separate sheets in the Excel file.

## The Hotelling's $T^2$ Control Chart

- If we don't have points plotting out-of-control in Phase I, then this is evidence to us that we have statistical control and that our estimated mean vector and v-c matrix are adequate for Phase II monitoring. 

\vskip 0.10 in

- So somewhat unlike the Shewhart $\bar{X}$ Chart, we don't bring our control limit forward per se, but we do bring forward our mean vector and v-c matrix that we used in Phase I. 

## The Multivariate EWMA Control Chart 

- Recall, the main issue with the Shewhart $\bar{X}$ chart is that it only uses information in the most recent sample in the calculation of its plotting statistic.
    - This inefficiency of data is addressed through both the CUSUM and EWMA charts.
    
\vskip 0.10 in

- The Hotelling's $T^2$ chart is a good chart for monitoring multivariate processes, but it also only uses information from the most recent sample making it a Shewhart-style chart.
    - This is where we can use the Multivariate EWMA chart to address this inefficiency.
    
## The Multivariate EWMA Control Chart

- The MEWMA is a logical extension of the univariate EWMA chart. The now vector $\mathbf{Z_i}$ is defined as:

$$ \mathbf{Z_i} = \lambda(\mathbf{x_{i} - \bar\bar{{x}})} + (1-\lambda)\mathbf{Z_{(i-1)}} $$

- where $0\leq\lambda\leq 1$ is the smoothing constant we used before and the vector $\mathbf{Z_0 = 0}$. 

## The Multivariate EWMA Control Chart

- The actual quantity plotted on the chart is:

$$ \mathbf{T_i^2 = Z^T_i\Sigma^{-1}_{Z_i}Z_i} $$

- where $\Sigma_{Z_i}$ is the variance-covariance matrix of the vector $\mathbf{Z_i}$ defined as:

$$ \frac{\lambda}{2-\lambda}\bigg[1-(1-\lambda)^{2i}\bigg]\mathbf{\Sigma} $$

## The Multivariate EWMA Control Chart

- If $\mathbf{T^2_i} > H$, then we say the process is out-of-control.

\vskip 0.10 in

- I've included in the files for today's lecture a table which shows us how to choose $H$ to achieve a desired $ARL_0$ value given the number of monitored streams and shift to be detected.

## Final Thoughts

- We've talked about the benefits of multivariate control charts and how they can be used to monitor processes with multiple quality characteristics.

\vskip 0.10 in

- But what is the main limitation? Complexity.

\vskip 0.10 in

- In aggregating lots of information together, we can lose sight of what's really going on in the process from a practical perspective.

\vskip 0.10 in

- Additionally, while in our examples it was very obvious which process was out-of-control, in practice, it might not always be so clear.
